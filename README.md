# Systemd Generic Service

A very simple basic template to quickly install a generic [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) service

## Usage

## Install

1. Clone repository
2. Modify and adjust your names

    Rename all files for customization of the service and edit all you need

3. Install (as root user)

    ```bash
    cd $NEW_NAME_OF_DIRECTORY
    ./install
    ```

### Uninstall (as root user)

```bash
cd $NEW_NAME_OF_DIRECTORY
./install uninstall
```

## TODO

- [ ] Write a script that spawns the service interactively
